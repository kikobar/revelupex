This Python script extracts data from .csv files created by the Revelup application and post it into a Postgres database.

**Requirements**

* Python installed on the machine running this application.
* Credentials with writing access to a Postgres database

**How to run this application**

* Copy the file `database.ini.sample` to `database.ini`.
* Edit `database.ini` with your credentials for the Postgres database.
* In Revelup run the following reports with output to `.csv` files:
  * Order History - run it for any range of dates.
  * Payment Summary - run it for any range of dates.
  * Product Mix - run it for a SPECIFIC DATE ONLY, so if you need a range of dates you will need to run multiple reports.
  * Hourly Sales - with the filters `Service Fees` and `Guests count` activated - run it for a SPECIFIC DATE ONLY, so if you need a range of dates you will need to run multiple reports.
* Copy all the `.csv` files generated by the Revelup reports to the `upload` folder.
* Run `python3 import_data.py`.
  * The application will do the following:
    * Read each line of data from the `.csv` files.
    * Insert the data into the Postgres database.
    * Move the `.csv` files to the `history` folder.
